                    <p> Hello, my name is <span id="name">Tyler Omoto</span> and I am currently a part of the University of Toronto Coding Boot Camp. By the end of this Bootcamp I will have all the tools necessary
                        to be a full stack developer. I will have all the knowledge in JavaScript, Node, SQL, MongoDB and React, in addition to what we have learned thus far in HTML and CSS. To sum myself up, I am a 
                        business degree graduate, who is now pursuing a career in programming and development.

                    <p>As my first project, I was asked by a marketing agency to increase its web acessibility, thus optimizing the site for search engines. As a part of the acceptance criteria,
                    the client asked for semantic HTML elements, alt attributes and for their headings to fall in sequential order, all without changing the look and feel of the site. By clicking on the image above,
                    you will be linked out to the website. <a href="https://github.com/tyomoto/pizza-cheese" target="_blank">This is the github link</a> to access the github repository to all the code and css for the above project.

                    <p>This was the first group project of the coding bootcamp from the University of Toronto. The task was to use two APIs to build and populate a site. This site combines the use of a local brewery api, as well as a mapquest api. When
                        a user inputs a city or location, the site will populate the 5 closest breweries to you and display the name, website, address and distance of each. It was a great first project where we didn't really have any guidelines,
                        and had a lot of freedome and creativity options. It was also great to experience what it would be like working in a group environment.

                    <p>This was the second group project of the coding bootcamp from the University of Toronto. The task was to utilize express, mysql and sequalize to build our own database and create a site for users. The site that we developed was
                        a movie review site, that allows for users to login and leave a review on movies that we have added to our database. There was a lot of troubleshooting and testing to make sure that all the routes we created and forms created all worked.
                        It was great to see a functioning final product and to visually see how far we have come along just past the halfway mark of this bootcamp. Clicking on the image above will display the project launched on heroku.
